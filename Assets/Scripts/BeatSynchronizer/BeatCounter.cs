/// This class is responsible for counting and notifying its observers when a beat occurs, specified by beatValue.
/// An offset beat value can be set to shift the beat (e.g. to create syncopation). If the offset is negative, it shifts to the left (behind the beat).
/// The accuracy of the beat counter is handled by loopTime, which controls how often it checks whether a beat has happened.
/// Higher settings for loopTime decreases load on the CPU, but will result in less accurate beat synchronization.
