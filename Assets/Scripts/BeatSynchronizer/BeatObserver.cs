/// This script needs to be added to any object that will observe a beat counter or pattern counter, and will receive notification
/// when a beat happens in the source audio through setting a bit mask whose bits correspond to specific beat types. For objects observing 
/// the pattern counter, the beat type is always OnBeat. 
/// The observing object should contain a script that polls for the current value of beatMask. When this value is non-zero, a beat has just fired. 
/// The beatWindow field specifies (in milliseconds) how long the beat stays active for, effectively behaving as a sensitivity/tolerance 
/// setting.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// By having individual beat observers attached to objects, finer control over sensitivity settings is granted to the client, which 
/// may contribute to lower CPU loads.
